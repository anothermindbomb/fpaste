Gather and paste various information about the running system. The info collected should be practically anonymous, and you may use the \-\-printonly or \-\-confirm options to preview what would be sent. paste.fedoraproject.org URLs are also practically anonymous ([a\-zA\-Z0\-9]**4 == 14,776,336 combinations), so you may also preview it instead before giving the link out.
